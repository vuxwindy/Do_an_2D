              Personal data includes data that identifies or can be used to
              identify a specific person, along with any data about that person.
              For example, your name, address, and payment information are
              personal data.
              <br />
              We act as a controller when we process personal data for our own
              use. For example, we act as a controller when you provide personal
              data to open an account.
              <br />
              This notice does not apply when our customers or others process
              personal data for their own benefit. For example, when a customer
              sends emails for their own business purposes that include personal
              data, the customer acts as a “controller.” When our customer acts
              as a controller, we act as a “processor” and process personal data
              only on the customer’s instructions or as required by law.

              <li>
                <strong>
                  The right to access, correct or delete your personal data
                </strong>

              <li>
                <strong>

              <li>

              Where appropriate and technically feasible, we will provide
              self-service and automated mechanisms to enable individuals to
              exercise their privacy rights. We also manually review requests to
              exercise privacy rights where self-service mechanisms are not
              appropriate or feasible. We will promptly review such requests to
              exercise privacy rights. If we need further information to process
              the request, we will contact the requester by email or, if the
              requester does not have an email address on file, by the same
              method as the request was made.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we do not act on the request for legal or other reasons, we
              will explain why we are not acting on the request, the right to
              appeal and any rights to lodge a complaint (if available where the
              requester lives).

              We manage some identification data directly. Other identifiers are
              managed by third parties. For example, we use Google Analytics to
              track website performance and visitor engagement.
            </p>

              We provide several methods to manage optional identifier settings.
              Individuals using our websites can manage their identifier
              settings by clicking Manage Privacy Settings via the link in this
              notice. Customers can also manage their identifier settings for
              our websites and services through their customer account settings.
              We do not provide mandatory identifier management because such
              identifiers are essential to providing our products and services.

            <p>
              <strong>“Do Not Track” and Other Optional Signals</strong>
              <br />
              Some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” feature. There is no
              generally accepted standard for this feature, and we do not
              respond to “Do Not Track” signs.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recognize common opt-out mechanisms, such as General Privacy
              Controls, where required by applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Storage</strong>
              <br />
              We store personal data on our own systems and with trusted service
              providers
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Retention Period</strong>
              <br />
              We retain personal data for as long as our business needs allow
              and to comply with the law. If we no longer need the personal
              data, we may delete or de-identify it so that it no longer
              identifies a specific person. We consider the following factors
              when deciding when to delete or deactivate your personal data: (1)
              whether you still have an account, (2) whether we are required to
              retain the personal data to comply with the law, or (3) whether
              the personal data is necessary for other business purposes for tax
              purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Security</strong>
              <br />
              We use risk-based measures to protect personal data, including
              appropriate security controls and employee training. We also
              require our service providers, business partners, and advertisers
              to use appropriate risk-based controls to protect personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>No personal data collected from children</strong>
              <br />
              We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the
              age of 18 without the consent of their legal guardian. Please
              contact us at thanhtrutinhbac@gmail.com if you believe that we
              have collected information from a child without the consent of
              their legal guardian.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>
              <br />
              We process personal data at the request of a person, with their
              consent, to perform a contract with us, based on our legitimate
              interests or other lawful grounds. The specific basis for
              processing depends on the service you are using, the data being
              processed, where the processing takes place and where you live. If
              you have any questions about the basis for processing your
              personal data, please contact us at thanhtrutinhbac@gmail.com.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Non-discrimination</strong>
              <br />
              We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy
              rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>No financial incentives</strong>
              <br />
              We do not offer any financial incentives for providing us with
              personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Changes to the policy</strong>
              <br />
              We may amend this global privacy notice by posting the amended
              statement at the same location as this Notice, at another location
              on our website, or by contacting customers directly. If we change
              this global privacy notice, the content of the notice will only
              apply to personal data collected before the new statement applies
              to the extent that the new statement does not reduce the rights of
              affected data subjects.
